## About

This project is a personal, fan-made tool created for board game
owners who want to enhance their experience with custom heroes ‚Äî

It uses assets from both the PC game and the official board game
rulebook, but is **not affiliated with Ubisoft or Archon Studio**
in any way.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
