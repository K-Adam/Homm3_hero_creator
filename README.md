## About

This project is a personal, fan-made tool created for board game
owners who want to enhance their experience with custom heroes â€”
including those found in the PC game but missing from the board game.

It uses assets from both the PC game and the official board game
rulebook, but is **not affiliated with Ubisoft or Archon Studio**
in any way.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
